henkka@void-linux:

"It all started when I realised I was hooked in a tiny electronic machine that pumps synthetic hormone in me." 

"What if this thing runs out of battery? What's going on here, where am I actually...?"

"The space around me looked dark, cold and empty, like the light of the stars had been dimmed by some impenetrable fog. Distant glow of articial light is a sign of something..."

# 	Somewhere in time and space	#
#	A pilot in a spaceship		#
# 	Infinite potential void		#

"Specific location unknown, switching to local area scanning... done"

"I landed on the spot recently and by accident. My personal starship started to fall apart after some forty years of service, and I had to make an emergency landing and come down to the surface..."

"Great, stuck in the middle of nowhere on a face of a moist and rocky planet, somewhere far far away in a mysterious distant galaxy. I wonder what's next...?"

"Take it easy, take a breath, have a break, get some rest. The ship needs some serious repairs, maybe the whole new upadated code system installation, I'm going to be be here for a while..."

" !Hyperspace drive fault! "

"Test run with the updated system was a partial success, as I got a file manager application Space FM to spawn. There's also some drawbacks, bar and window tiling stopped working...?"

"Fixed the key binding typos in the river wm init file. The debug log shows several keyboard-related warnings, some XF86-bindings could not be resolved. Commented out the related lines."

"Added and edited some application shortcuts, let's see if they work any better now..."

"For some reason the whole graphical desktop environment has slowed down a lot, maybe it has something to do with the updates...?"

#	Progress			#
-Space FM file manager installed and tested
-floating windows work better than before
-reboot or poweroff via foot terminal is a safer way to turn off the computer completely or return to the main shell CLI session.

#	Issues and bugs			#
-tiling stopped working after updates
-some applications won't launch properly
-keyboard/screen still hangs after keyboard shortcut exit

"I need to reconfigure..."
