HaLiux OS Developement Project - README

This project was started as a personal developement project for learning a new profession in computer sciences.

Goal of this project is to develop a personally tailored operating system for home, local network and office use.

HaLiux OS is based on Void Linux and River WM, and has many special enhancement features that improve usability and workflow. A tuned user interface with tiling window management, keyboard shortcuts, voice control, mobile synchronization, HUD-screen menu and AI-implementations. All the essential office and media applications are included, naturally. A software developement environment and additional productivity tools are also installed in HaLiux OS.

#Design goals
-speed, based on a minimal base system and a fast window manager
-special core features: musl, runit, wayland, zig
-productivity enhancements with tiling and integrated AI
-H-layout, workspaces, window overview, taskbar
-system administration: configurations and settings manager
-desktop functionality: clipboard, screenshots, notifications
-email,chat, calendar, personal journal, task-manager, project log
-office applications: calculator, notepad, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, pdf
-SDE: project manager, text-editor, AI-codemod, git, zig, compilers and debug tools
-multimedia production capabilities, DAw, GIMP, video editor
-HUD for fullscreen mode menu access and cool effects
-cheatsheet quickbar for keyboard command learning support
-voice control and private local network LLM-server
-mobile-device content and control synchronization
-private local network cloud collaboration platform
-advanced networking security options: vpn, tor, veilid, LAN firewall proxy
-enhanced privacy, system-level ad- and tracker-blocking
-GPUs configured for optimal performance and maximum usage

Then a little bit of background information about myself and why I started this project.

Due to a chronical illness related health issues, I cannot practice my current profession anymore. I used to be a carpenter building and repairing wooden houses, structures and cabinets. I needed to find a way to get a flexible part-time job or earn income at home otherwise, so I decided to learn a new profession in computer sciences. So here I am, in the beginning of this personal learning journey, writing my own first ever GitHub README.md file.

As I am new to the coding world, with only some previous casual hobbyist experience and basic level Linux skills, I don't have any code or screenshots to share yet. There will be some interesting updates to this repository in the future, but until then there's only my personal project log that I can publish. It's written in a weird imaginative humorous? style to amuse myself, but also acts as a project log and notes for this serius attempt to qonquer the infinite cyberhyper codespace universe...

Henkka just entered the Void.
